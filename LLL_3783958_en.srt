I swear to God, it was so good. 
Completely done!

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,920
I know, I know. 
It's... it's complete nonsense.

5
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,760
This is absurd...

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,720
“Madness! Pure madness!”

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,760
But what problems does it have? I'm going, I'm going.

9
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,920
- A cappuccino, please. 
- Of course, right away.

10
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,640
- It offers the house. 
- Oh, no, thanks. I'd like to pay.

You thought so! Shit!

14
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,840
- Mia, where do you think you're going? 
- To the doctor.

15
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
- It's better that it comes earlier, tomorrow. 
- Okay.

16
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,760
Have a good evening!

17
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,080
Oh!

18
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,480
It was very well done! 
It was pure madness, it was...

19
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,080
It was crazy and I... 
Oh, you were dying there.

20
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,200
No, Turner is fine. 
Turner is fine. It's just that, um...

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,720
You'll be waiting to be in Denver...

22
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,080
What?

23
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,360
Okay.

24
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
No, I'm happy for you.

25
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,160
Really, I'm happy for you, it's just...

26
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,520
I was just thinking...

27
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,800
- I don't know what I was thinking, I guess... 
- Just a second.

28
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,520
- What's up, Ruby? 
- [Woman] Jessica's on the phone.

29
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,680
- Tell her I'll call her back. 
- [Woman] In two minutes?

30
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,920
Even less. I'm almost done. 
Thanks.

31
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Do you know what's up? 
I think that may be enough, we'll let you know.

33
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,280
Wow! Holy shit! 
How about opening the window?

34
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,280
- I wanted you to take effect. 
- Thanks.

35
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Mine! How was the audition?

36
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,680
- Hey... 
- As usual. Was Jen or Rachel there?

37
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,440
- I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. 
- The worst.

38
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
Well, I don't know if they were there.

39
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,040
- I bet so. 
- Why is there a meeting in the bathroom?

40
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,520
Two minutes, girls. 
Mia, you're coming, aren't you?

41
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,320
- I can't! I need to work. 
- What?

42
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
Did he say, “Work”?

43
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,760
- What's up? 
- I'm sorry it didn't go well,

44
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,640
There are four deals you would be 
perfect for, but now, come with us!

45
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,760
- It will be a blast! 
- It won't be a hoot.

46
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,280
- It could be. 
- No.

47
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,160
It will be full of social climbers,

48
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,720
all crammed into one of those 
huge glass houses.

49
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,280
I know this.

50
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,840
- I was about to return it to you. 
- How long have you had it?

51
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,840
- For a long time. 
- Come on, Mia.

52
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,360
When do you happen to see 
all the Hollywood stereotypes again

53
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,920
piled up in the same room? 
We can make fun of them all!

54
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,920
You disappoint me, Lex. 
There's nothing to make fun of.

55
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,240
There will be the crème de la crème 
of mankind at this party.

Stop sneaking into my house.

63
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,040
Would Mom and Dad 
call this' home '?

64
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,000
What are you doing? Please, no. 
Don't sit up here.

65
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,040
- Are you kidding? 
- Don't sit here. Get up.

66
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
- This is where Hoagy Carmichael sat! 
- Oh, my God!

67
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
- He threw the Baked Potato away. 
- I wonder why.

68
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,920
- And now you sit on it. 
- I got you a rug.

69
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,240
- I don't need it. 
- If I told you that Miles Davis

70
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,760
- did he piss on it? 
- Don't be blasphemous. Is it true?

71
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,080
When are you going to decide 
to empty these boxes?

72
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,400
- When can I empty them in my club. 
- Oh, Sebastian.

73
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,280
It's like a girl 
dumped you and you were stalking her.

74
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,080
You don't go there anymore, are you?

75
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,800
It's that...

76
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,880
You'll never believe it, they 
turned it into a samba-tapas place.

77
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,680
- Oh, my God, Sebastian! 
- Samba tapas.

78
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,360
Pick one, right? 
Do one thing, but do it well.

79
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,400
- There is someone I want to introduce you to. 
- I don't want to know anyone.

80
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,680
- No, I don't want to know anyone. 
- Did dad give it to you?

81
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,480
- Yes. 
- You'll like her.

82
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,120
I don't think I'll like it. 
Do you like jazz?

83
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,800
- Probably not. 
- So what would we talk about?

84
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,640
I don't know! It doesn't matter. Okay? 
Live like a hermit.

85
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,120
- Drive without insurance! 
- Doesn't it matter?

86
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, I know a guy with a 
tattooed face that you should know.

87
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,120
- Okay, this is a low shot. 
- He has a heart of gold.

88
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
- Be serious! 
- 'Be serious'? Laura, I had...

89
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,440
I had some very serious plans 
for my future.

90
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,360
- I know. 
- It's not my fault, if I was deceived.

91
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
You have not been deceived. 
You've been robbed!

92
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,440
- What difference is there? 
- I don't know. It's not that romantic.

93
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,480
Don't sit...

94
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,480
Everyone knew 
he was an untrustworthy guy, except you.

95
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,760
Why did you say 'romantic' 
like it was a swear word?

96
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,080
The bills to pay 
aren't romantic. Call her.

97
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,280
- I'm not going to call her. 
- Call her.

98
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,640
And the problem is that you're acting like life 
has put me on the ropes.

99
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I want to be put on the ropes. Okay?

100
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
I want life to hit me 
until it gets tired of it.

101
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,520
So, later, I can fight back. 
It's the classic 'crush and hit'.

102
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,520
Whatever you want, Muhammad Ali. I love you. 
Empty the boxes.

103
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,360
- I'll change the lock. 
- You can't afford it.

104
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,360
I am a phoenix 
that will rise from its ashes.

- Hey. 
- Bill.

107
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
- Thanks for letting me come back. 
- Imagine.

108
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,880
Know that you have a new man in front of you.

109
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,120
- A man happy to be here. 
- Great.

110
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,240
- A man who is easy to work with. 
- And will you stick to the lineup?

111
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
I would be happy about it.

112
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,600
Although I don't think anyone 
cares what I play, but yes.

113
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,120
Well... if by 'someone' you mean someone 
else besides me, then you're right.

114
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,000
I care 
and I don't want to listen to free jazz.

115
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Agreed. It's okay. 
Although I thought that, in this city,

116
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,760
we should go ahead with a 
system like 'your piece, my piece'.

117
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
How about 'two yours and one mine'?

118
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,080
I get it, 'all yours and none mine'?

119
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,680
- That's great. 
- Okay. Consensual decision, therefore.

120
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,760
- That's right. Taken by me. 
- Right.

121
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
- And I approved it, so... 
- Think what you want.

122
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,360
Bill. Welcome back.

123
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,840

Seb.

129
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,600
I understand what you're saying, but I don't 
think you said what you're thinking.

130
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,880
Then you don't understand, you're fired.

131
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,040
Yes, that's what you say, but it's not 
what you think. What you think is...

132
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,720
- You are fired. 
- Stick to the lineup.

133
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,880
- No, I said it's too late. 
- It's a warning.

134
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,840
- But what planet do you live on? You're done here. 
- Don't fire me. Don't fire me.

135
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,520
- Sorry, Seb. 
- It's Christmas.

136
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,800
Yes, I noticed the decorations. 
Happy New Year.

137
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880

“Hey, Bella, 
don't you think you're exaggerating?”

00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,760
“No, Jamal. You're the one who exaggerates.”

- Hi! 
- Hi.

- Meet my friend, Carlo. 
- Hi, Carlo.

- Carlo, this is Mia. 
- Pleasure. Mine?

- Yes, Mia. 
- Pleasure. How is it going?

152
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
Carlo is a writer.

153
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,280
Yeah. They say it is good 
for creating new worlds.

154
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,720
They are the center of attention.

155
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,160
There are a lot of rumors going around, people are 
talking about me, which is exhilarating.

156
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,680
You work hard 
and then you get a lot of recognition.

157
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,680
- I'm going to get a drink. 
- Okay.

158
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,080
It was a pleasure.

159
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560

Okay, Piano Man, stroke those keys. 
Let's get inside.

165
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,360
One, two, three, four!

166
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,120
Well done!

167
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
[inaudible voices]

168
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,240
[sings on the song]

169
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,360
It's okay. I remember you.

170
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,240
And, I admit, 
I was rude that night.

171
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,720
- Rude? 
- Okay, I've been a dick. I confess.

172
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,560
But asking a 
serious musician for 'I Ran' seems like an exaggeration to me.

173
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,520
Oh, Lord! 
Did you just say, “A serious musician”?

174
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,520
- I don't think so. 
- Can I borrow your clothes?

175
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,360
- Why? 
- Next week I have an audition.

176
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,360
- I will play the part of a serious firefighter. 
- So, you're an actress.

177
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,880
In fact, you have a familiar face. 
Have I seen you anywhere yet?

178
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,480
“At the coffee shop at the 
Warner Brothers Studios.” It's a great classic.

179
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,680
- Ah, I see. 
- Yeah.

180
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,480
You're a bartender. 
That's why you're looking at me from top to bottom.

181
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,280
Come on, it's getting better.

182
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,280
He doesn't... he doesn't give me orders.

183
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,160
- He just... gave you an order. 
- I know. I let him.

184
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,880
- What's your name? 
- Mine.

185
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,480
Mia.

186
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,840
Guess I'll see you again in some movies.

187
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,600
- Do you know Joseph Campbell? 
- Um... yes.

188
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,000
I came up with the idea to rework 
'Goldilocks and the Three Bears',

189
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,000
but from the point of view of bears.

190
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,080
- “The Hero's Journey.” 
- A series of films could result from it.

191
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,640
- Sure. 
- There could be a fourth bear.

192
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,920
George Michael!

193
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,480
- Hi. 
- Excuse me.

194
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,080
- Imagine. 
- He's a friend.

195
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,720
Did you get the keys?

196
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,120
- Yes. 
- Can you take mine too?

197
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,240
- What? 
- Could you take my keys?

198
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,000
- I can't hear you. 
- Would you take my keys?

199
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,880
- Please? 
- Now yes.

200
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,520
- Thank you. 
- Not at all.

201
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,800
- What car? 
- The Prius.

202
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,040
- It's not much help. 
- With the green ribbon.

203
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Oh, okay.

204
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
- [Seb] They look... comfortable. 
- All right.

205
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,480
Thanks for saving me earlier.

206
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Well, it's not like it 
left me much choice.

207
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,640
It's a bit strange that we keep 
meeting.

208
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,440
It's strange, yes.

209
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,120
- Maybe it means something. 
- I doubt it.

210
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,400
- Yeah, I don't think so either. 
- Where is my car?

211
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,400
You should put that thing on your chin.

212
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
- This? 
- Yes.

213
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,840
Turn your head 
into an antenna, so...

214
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,880
You get cancer, 
but you find the car right away.

215
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
- What? 
- You wouldn't live long,

216
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,640
but you'd get to your destination first, 
so the score will even out.

217
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,640
- It's a terrible thing. 
- It's just advice.

218
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
You are a real...

219
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,280
- What is the most appropriate term? 
- Knight in Shining Armor?

220
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,240
- Weird. Here's the right word. 
- Okay.

221
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,200
- [Seb] Quite a bad show, huh? 
- I've seen better.

222
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
[cellphone ringing]

223
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,000
Hi, Greg.

224
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,720
Oh, sorry, I'm late.

225
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,280
Yes. I'll be here right away. Okay, hi.

226
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,520
[car beeping]

227
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,040
- It was right here. 
- Right here.

228
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,760
Can I take you to your car?

229
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,560
No, I have it a short walk away.

230
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,920
Goodnight.

231
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,320
Goodnight.

232
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,040
Excuse me. 
This is gluten-free, isn't it?

233
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,320
- No. 
- How?

234
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,600
In this case, I'd like the money back.

235
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Okay. Let me ask.

236
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,600
- My... 
- Hi. You close on Friday.

237
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,480
I can't... I can't close on Friday. 
I have an audition.

238
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,040
Do you think I care? Move it.

239
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,160
Oh, and 
we'll have a good talk tomorrow, okay?

240
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,920
- Fix your apron, please. 
- Okay.

241
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,640
You again!

242
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,600
- What are you doing here? 
- Oh, the usual, meetings with...

243
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,040
- the directors of the Studios and... 
- How did you get into the Studios?

244
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,840
I basically escaped security at the 
gates, so...

245
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,680
I think I have 20 minutes 
before they find me.

246
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,880
- Isn't it that you can take a break? 
- I'll finish in 10 minutes.

247
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
- Can I hide in the bathroom? 
- Yes.

248
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,880
Okay.

249
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,160
Excuse me.

250
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I still need to ask. 
Excuse me for a second.

251
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,840
From there, Humphrey Bogart 
and Ingrid Bergman appeared in 'Casablanca. '

252
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,080
Wow! It's amazing that you work 
right across the street.

253
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,840
- Yes. 
- It's magnificent.

254
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,840
[Seb] What was your name... 
your Bogart? What is it that it's called?

255
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,240
- Greg? 
- Yes. Greg.

256
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,880
Understood. And how long have you been...

257
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,520
- We've been going out together for about a month. 
- Great.

258
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,120
It's... it's tender. Anyway, I like 
being in the middle of all this, you know?

259
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,360
I know what you mean. I'm going 
to have coffee 10 kilometers away

260
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,400
- to stay close to a jazz club. 
- Seriously?

261
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
Yes, the Van Beek. Do you know him?

262
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,880
All the major leaders of swing 
bands played there: Count Basie, Chick Webb...

263
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,480
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas place 
now.

264
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,400
- What is a samba-tapas place? 
- A samba club where they serve tapas.

265
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,880
- Oh. 
- Yeah. And who is the loser?

266
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,320
The story? 
I wouldn't know. This is Los Angeles.

267
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,320
They worship everything, 
but they don't value anything.

268
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,240
- We're about to shoot, you can't get through. 
- Okay.

269
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,200
- Are you spinning? 
- Yes.

270
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,600
Yes, I understand. In my street they go around 
all the time, no problem.

271
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,560
Let's go through here.

272
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,160
- Oh! I love it! 
- Here we go.

273
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,520
Hey, Mia! 
How did you end up in this world?

274
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,240
- And... engine! 
- In what world?

275
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,920
- You know, the movies, the acting... 
- Action!

276
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,280
- Oh... my aunt was an actress. 
- Oh, okay.

277
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,640
He was part 
of a traveling theater company.

278
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,920
I grew up 
in Boulder City, Nevada.

279
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,200
In front of my house, there was a library 
that had a film sector.

280
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,800
So, she... she took me there and we spent 
a whole day watching old movies,

281
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,200
like “Notorious - The Lost Lover” 
and... “Susanna!” and “Casablanca”.

282
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,520
All right, Stop!

283
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,320
- Now we can talk. 
- Looks like he was smart.

284
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,920
He was definitely smart. I was 
organizing plays in my room and...

285
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,600
Basically, she and I were 
reviving the scenes from those movies.

286
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,160
- And then I would write my own screenplays. 
- Wow.

287
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,600
I love this place.

288
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,280
[Mia] Two years after coming here, 
I dropped out of college

289
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,080
and my last audition was 
for a teen show,

290
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,720
presented as a cross 
between 'Dangerous Thoughts' and 'The O.C. '

291
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,720
So, yes... 
I should have been a lawyer.

292
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,240
- [Seb] Because the world needs lawyers. 
- It's not that there are less actresses!

293
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,120
- You are not just an actress. 
- What do you mean by: 'Only an actress'?

294
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
You said it yourself. 
You're a... playwright prodigy.

295
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,760
- That's not what I said. 
- Because you are too modest, but it's true.

296
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,560
You could write the roles yourself.

297
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,920
Write something interesting, 
of your own, without auditioning for them...

298
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,840
presumptuous ignorant people. 
Take Louis Armstrong.

299
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,720
He could have limited himself to playing 
the sheet music of the band they gave him.

300
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,480
- But no. And what did he do? 
- What did he do?

301
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,880
He made history, didn't he?

302
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Then I'll stop 
auditioning and make history.

303
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,280
Well, my work here is done.

304
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,000
Probably, at this point, 
I should tell you something...

305
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,280
So let's get rid of our minds, 
I hate jazz.

306
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,560
- Are you okay? 
- What does it mean that you hate jazz?

307
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,360
It means that 
when I listen to it, I don't like it.

308
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,400
Yes, but it's a general statement 
that you don't like jazz.

309
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,200
What do you have to do now?

310
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,600
Nothing.

311
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
[jazz music]

312
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,000
I believe that people, when they say...

313
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,000
things like: “I hate jazz”...

314
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,320
I think... it doesn't have a context, it 
doesn't know where it came from.

315
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,280
Jazz was born in a small... 
New Orleans Stamberg,

316
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,880
Where the people were all crowded together, they 
spoke five different languages

317
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,800
and they couldn't understand each other. The only means 
of communication... was jazz.

318
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,120
And what about Kenny G?

319
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,560
- How? 
- What can you tell me about Kenny G?

320
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,520
I mean, how about 
elevator music?

321
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,240
You know, the jazz I know?

322
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,240
- So what? 
- From my experience?

323
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,800
- I find it relaxing. 
- It's not relaxing. No, not at all.

324
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,000
Sidney Bechet shot someone because he 
told him he had a wrong note.

325
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,600
- It's not relaxing at all. 
- Even where I grew up

326
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,600
there was a radio station 
called KJAZZ 103.

327
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,000
And people would tune in to that 
station, during cocktail parties.

328
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,920
- Understood. 
- And he was talking about it.

329
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,720
- I know. 
- Because it was...

330
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,320
That is the problem. Ok.

331
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,000
I think part of the problem 
is that you don't listen properly.

332
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,200
You have to understand 
everything that is at stake.

333
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,720
I mean, look at these guys. 
Observe the... saxophonist.

334
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,920
He has taken possession of the song. 
He transported her to a world of her own.

335
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,040
Each of them creates, rearranges, 
composes and then plays the melody. They are...

336
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,920
Now look at the trumpet player. 
He has an idea all his own.

337
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,680
And it's full of contrasts... 
of compromises and it's...

338
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,640
Every time it's new. 
Every night, it's completely new.

339
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,400
It's very, very exciting.

340
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,240
And it's dying. He's dying, Mia.

341
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,600
It's dying out. 
And the whole world says:

342
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,760
“Let him die. He's had his 
time.” Well, not while I'm here.

343
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,920
- What do you want to do? 
- I want to open a club of my own.

344
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,560
- Seriously? 
- Yes.

345
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,480
We'll play what we want, 
when we want,

346
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,840
as we want, 
as long as it's exclusively... jazz.

347
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,640
Hi, this is Mia Dolan. 
Yes, I didn't hear the call.

348
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,400
[jazz music]

349
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,080
- They want a second audition! 
- What? But come on!

350
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,400
- For what? 
- For a television program.

351
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,400
What I told you about earlier.

352
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,400
The cross between 'Dangerous Thoughts' 
and 'The O.C. '?

353
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,280
- Yes. This is so exciting! 
- Congratulations! It's incredible!

354
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,160
I think 
I've said some bad things before.

355
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,760
- How? 
- It's a bit like in 'Burnt Youth'.

356
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,240
“I had the bullets!”

357
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,080
That's right!

358
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,000
- You've never seen it! 
- I've never seen it.

359
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,560
I can't believe it! 
They're screening it at the Rialto.

360
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,760
- Really? 
- Yes.

361
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,280
You should go there... 
I mean, I can take you too.

362
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,400
- Okay. 
- As a study.

363
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,720
- As a study. Agreed. 
- Okay.

364
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,360
- Monday evening at 22:00. 
- Yes, perfect! Perfect.

365
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
- Okay. 
- As a study.

366
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,360
[whistle]

367
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,520
- Put yourself here, please. 
- A lot of pleasure.

368
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,680
- Good. 
- Hi.

369
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
- Whenever he wants. 
- Okay.

370
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,480
“You have two choices: either follow my 
rules or follow my rules. Do you understand?”

371
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,040
Thank you.

372
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,520
- But... 
- Thanks.

373
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,200
- I can recite it differently. 
- No, that's fine. Thank you so much.

374
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,880
Thank you.

375
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,560
- It was fun. 
- Goodbye.

376
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,360
Oh, hey, Mia?

377
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,480
- Hey. 
- Greg is here.

378
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,800
Hi, sweetheart. 
I found a seat in front of me.

379
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,840
- Great. 
- We should go.

380
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,920
- Okay. 
- My brother landed early.

381
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,680
- Have you forgotten it? You've forgotten it. 
- It was this evening.

382
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,400
- Alright. You've forgotten it. 
- Yes. It's okay.

383
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,280
- Look, I'll change on the fly. 
- Okay.

384
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,880
- Good. Perfect. 
- Okay.

385
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,200
[cellphone ringing]

386
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,680
Here, it's him. Hi, Josh, yes.

387
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,840
I stopped by to pick up Mia. 
We'll be there in...

388
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,680
- We have a surround and it's like... 
- It's like being at the movies.

389
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,880
- Wow. 
- It's even better than being at the movies.

390
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,680
- Can't wait. 
- You know what today's cinemas are like.

391
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,080
- Yeah. They are so dirty. 
- Yeah, they stink.

392
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,080
And it's either too hot or too cold.

393
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,120
The quality has expired too much, 
it's terrible.

394
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,560
Someone is always texting.

395
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,560
[alert from the cell phone] 
It's something that... Just a moment.

396
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,120
- Ready? 
- It's probably the job.

397
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,240
[speaks in Chinese]

398
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,040
- Sorry. So, yes, we love it. 
- Oh, it's beautiful.

399
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,200
- We should visit you, I would say. 
- You should. Jump in.

400
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,280
[Greg] I'll tell you just one word: Indonesia.

401
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,240
I don't know. I don't remember it very well, but, 
in all honesty, it changed my life.

402
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,880
- Seriously? 
- Oh, yes. It left its mark on me.

403
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,680
An incredible journey.

404
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,320
- Was it good? 
- Yes.

405
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,480
A five-star Eco Resort 
in the jungle.

406
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,360
- Wow. 
- Exceptional.

407
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,000
We were thinking about Nicaragua.

408
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,920
The fact is that Nicaragua is less 
advanced. It's a bit underdeveloped.

409
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,000
Doesn't seem so sure to me.

410
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,680
- I don't know, I don't think it's safe. 
- Yes, you're right.

411
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,280
Yeah, you don't want 
to go too far into exploration.

412
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,920
[voices disappear]

413
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,640
[piano music]

414
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,160
Excuse me.

415
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,800
[film in original language]

416
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,880
[buzz]

417
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,280
I have an idea.

418
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,320
[sweet music]

419
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,720
- What is it? A script? 
- A play.

420
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,600
A play? You'd better 
give all of us a part!

421
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,160
Actually, it's a monologue! 
So I can't.

422
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,880
[horn]

423
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,320
Wow. Will he do this every time?

424
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,920
I think so.

425
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,760
[Mia] It's one-way!

426
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,360
[braking]

427
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,640

01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,800
[jazz music]

429
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,080
- I love you. 
- Me too.

430
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,640
Sebastian?

431
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,880
- Keith. 
- Come here, man.

432
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,280
- How are you? 
- All right, man.

433
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,640
- She is Mia. Mine, Keith. 
- Hi, Mia. Pleasure.

434
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,240
- My pleasure. 
- I used to play with him.

435
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,880
- We went to school together. 
- How are you doing, brother?

436
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,880
- Very good. It's never been better. And you? 
- Very good. I have so much to do.

437
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,680
- I have a new complex. 
- Good. Great.

438
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,640
We're looking for a pianist.

439
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,920
- Are you kidding me? 
- No, I'm not kidding you.

440
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,240
- No, I'm fine like this. 
- Sure? You make good money.

441
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,800
I'm good to go.

442
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,320
Let's get something to drink for 
once. It's been a long time.

443
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,040
- It was a pleasure, Mia. 
- Even for me.

444
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,160
Curtain.

445
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,640
Brilliant.

446
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,880
- Really? Seriously? 
- Yes.

447
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,680
- It seems very melancholic to me. 
- That's the point.

448
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,240
- Will people like it? 
- Fuck everyone.

449
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,320
- You always say that. 
- Well, I am firmly convinced of this.

450
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,920
- I did something for you. 
- What is it about?

451
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,280
It's for your place.

452
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,280
- Why does it say 'Seb's? ' 
- Why you should call it 'Seb's. '

453
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,040
Nobody would go to a place 
called Piano with Chicken.

454
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,880
Is there a musical note as an apostrophe? 
Strong.

455
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,400
- Yeah. 
- It will be called 'Piano with the chicken'.

456
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,640
Why did Charlie 
Parker get his nickname...

457
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,400
I know, from his passion for chicken.

458
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,000
That's why they called him 'Bird'.

459
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,000
There will be chicken, beer, jazz... 
“Slow with the chicken.”

460
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,640
I get it. I think you'd better give 
up chicken.

461
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,360
- and leave only the drinks and jazz and... 
- I'm not going to give up the chicken.

462
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,120
- And you could open it somewhere else. 
- What do you say...

463
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,120
- Find another point. 
- It will be the Van Beek.

464
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,120
Well, it doesn't have to be 
the Van Beek.

465
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,760
I can't let his story 
be ruined with samba.

466
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,160
I can't do it.

467
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,320
- You could do it, but you refuse. 
- Your work is incredible.

468
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,360
You know... the whole world 
seen from your bedroom.

469
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,200
What more do they want? 
Who would be able to do that?

470
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
- I can do it. 
- You can do it.

471
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,640
Who was the guy at the Lighthouse?

472
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,880
- What he asked you to play? 
- Keith.

473
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,280
- Yes. Why was there tension between you? 
- There is always tension, with him.

474
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,920
- Really? 
- Yeah.

475
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,320
I thought it was nice, 
since he offered you a job.

476
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,240
- Will you call him? 
- No.

477
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,040
- No. 
- Okay.

478
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,120
So...

479
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,680
- here's what we know. 
- Would it be?

480
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,480
For sure, it will be called 
“Piano with Chicken”...

481
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,680
and your play will be a triumph.

482
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:51,640
[Mia] It's a monologue, so it's just 
going to be me... No, I mean, I act, too.

483
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:56,200
[Mia] No, mom. They won't pay me. 
I'll have to pay to stage it.

484
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,360
[Mia] He's great. 
Soon a jazz club of its own will open.

485
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,480
[Mia] Yes, it's going to be amazing.

486
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,840
[Mia] No, she hasn't opened it yet, 
she needs some...

487
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,440
[Mia] He's putting 
the money aside, I think.

488
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,480
[Mia] No, she doesn't have a permanent job, 
but she's working on it,

489
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,320
It's just a bit of a complicated period.

490
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,640
[Mia] He'll find a way to open it 
and you'll love it to death, okay?

491
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,880
[Mia] How's dad?

492
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,920
[jazz music]

493
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,000
Sebastian! Go in, man.

494
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,160
- Thanks for coming. 
- Thanks to you for calling me.

495
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,320
I wasn't sure you would come.

496
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,600
- So, here's how it works. 
- Let's hear.

497
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,320
Universal distributes it to us.

498
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,760
We have our own brand. 
We are about to start a tour.

499
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,720
We can give you 
a thousand dollars a week,

500
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,400
plus a share from ticket sales 
and merchandise. Is it okay with you?

501
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,760
- Sebastian? 
- That's fine.

502
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,360
- Let's play. 
- Okay.

503
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,240
[jazz music]

504
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,160
[vocalize]

505
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,880
[modern base]

506
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,200
I know that. It's different.

507
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,680
You say you want to save jazz.

508
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,280
How can you save jazz 
if no one listens to it?

509
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,760
Jazz is dying 
because of people like you.

510
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,080
You... play for the 90-year-olds at 
Lighthouse.

511
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,600
Where are the kids? 
Where are the young people?

512
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,920
You're so obsessed 
with Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk.

513
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,920
They were revolutionaries.

514
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,040
How can you be a revolutionary, 
if you are such a traditionalist?

515
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,400
You cling to the past... 
but jazz speaks of the future.

516
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,640
I know.

517
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,800
That other one... 
He wasn't as good as you.

518
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,040
But you're such a pain in the ass, bro.

519
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,520
[jazz music on the piano]

525
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,280
Hi, it's me.

526
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,760
I have no idea where you are now. 
I believe in Boston.

527
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,120
Or maybe in Dallas, I don't know.

528
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,520
I haven't heard from you in a while...

529
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,720
and I miss you.

530
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,240
Okay, hi.

531
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,840
[jazz music]

532
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,120
I was thinking... Surprise.

533
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,040
I'll be leaving early tomorrow, 
but I needed to see you...

534
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,280
[Seb] It's good to be home.

535
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,800
I'm happy you're here.

536
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,480
- How is it going with the opera? 
- Um...

537
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,880
- I'm nervous. 
- Really?

538
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,040
- Why? 
- Why... if they come to see me?

539
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,400
Don't give a shit!

540
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,080
Are you nervous about what they're going to say?

541
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,560
I'm nervous about having to do it. 
I can't wait to go up...

542
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,520
on a stage in front of an audience. 
I mean, I don't need to explain it to you.

543
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,920
- It's going to be incredible. 
- You don't understand, but... I'm afraid.

544
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,520
They should 
consider themselves lucky to attend.

545
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,520
- I am impatient. 
- Not me.

546
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,320
- When are you leaving? In the morning? 
- Yes. At 6:45am.

547
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,360
For Boise.

548
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,480
- Ox? 
- Boise.

549
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,120
To Boise!

550
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,520
You should come.

551
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,240
In Boise?

552
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,880
Yes, so you can take it 
off your to-do list.

553
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,880
Oh, that would be... 
really exciting. If only I could.

554
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,880
What will you do after the tour?

555
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,920
- And why can't you? 
- Coming to Boise?

556
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,840
- Yes. 
- Because I have to try.

557
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,000
But can't you try everywhere?

558
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,800
Wherever you go?

559
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,920
Yes, everywhere.

560
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,240
All my stuff is here and it's in 
two weeks, so I don't think it's...

561
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,600
- Okay. 
- Good idea, maybe not now, but...

562
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,440
I would like so much.

563
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,240
We must try to see each other 
only when we see each other.

564
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,800
I know, but after you're done.

565
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,640
What do you mean?

566
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,640
After you're done with the tour?

567
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,280
After we're done, we'll record 
and then we'll do another tour.

568
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,560
Let's go on the tour to record 
the record and then do a tour again.

569
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,320
That's how it works.

570
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,080
So, is this a long-term thing?

571
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,320
What does 'Long Term' mean?

572
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:30,200
I mean long-term, I mean, you're going to be 
in this band for a long time.

573
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,200
Touring.

574
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,880
- What did you think I would do? 
- I'm not...

575
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,240
Actually, I haven't thought much 
about this. I didn't think the band...

576
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,800
Didn't you think it could succeed?

577
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,000
No, that's not exactly what 
I meant. I just wanted to say that you...

578
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,440
I mean, now you're going to be on tour for... 
How much? Months? Years?

579
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,760
Yes. I don't think that... That's how it is. 
It's plausible, it could be for...

580
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,320
I could be on tour... for a 
couple of years, at least, just for this record.

581
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,560
Do you like the music you play?

582
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,200
I don't know...

583
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,080
I don't know how much it matters.

584
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,360
Well, it has to do with it, because 
if you have to give up on your dream...

585
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:22,600
I think it's important that you like 
what you're going to play around for years to come.

586
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,840
- Do you like the music I play? 
- Yes.

587
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,640
I like it. I just didn't think 
you liked it too.

588
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,320
- Yes, well... 
- You always say Keith is the worst

589
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,320
and, now, you're going to be touring with him 
for years, so I couldn't...

590
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,480
- to see if I was happy. 
- What are you trying to do?

591
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,400
- Why are you doing this? 
- Why do I do this in what way?

592
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,400
- I thought you wanted this for me. 
- Now it seems that you don't want it anymore.

593
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,880
What does it mean, did I want this for you?

594
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,200
- That's what you wanted me to do. 
- To be part of this band?

595
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,160
Being part of a band. Have 
a permanent job, do you understand?

596
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,200
Being... you know.

597
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,560
Of course I 
want you to have a permanent job,

598
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,840
so you can think about yourself 
and your life and open your club.

599
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,360
I'm doing it. So I don't understand. 
Why aren't we celebrating?

600
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,360
Why don't you open your club?

601
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,920
You said 
that no one would want to go there.

602
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,320
That no one would join a club 
called Slow with the Chicken.

603
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,560
- And you change the name! 
- Nobody likes jazz! Not even to you!

604
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:19,880
- Now I like jazz, thanks to you! 
- This is what I thought you wanted for me!

605
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,160
What should I do? 
Going back to playing 'Jingle Bells'?

606
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
I'm not saying that...

607
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,880
Save to the bone 
and open a club that would remain empty?

608
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,120
It wouldn't remain empty 
because yours is a passion

609
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,320
and people love passions! 
Do people remember that

610
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,720
- that they have forgotten. 
- That's not how it went for me.

611
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,080
Yes, it's like you say, okay? Do you know what I'm saying? 
It's time to grow.

612
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,520
I have a stable job, 
this is what I do.

613
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,160
And if you have any problems

614
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,640
You should have told me about it before I signed 
that contract!

615
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:54,200
I just want to point out 
that you had a dream that you were chasing...

616
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,560
But this is a dream! It's a dream.

617
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,880
- It's not your dream! 
- People like me work all their lives

618
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,360
to be part of something 
that succeeds, that people like.

619
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,080
I mean, 
I'm finally doing something that satisfies people.

620
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,080
Since when do you care about 
having consent?

621
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,080
Why do you care 
about others liking you?

622
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,680
You are an actress! 
Do you need to ask me?

623
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,120
[music stops]

624
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,720
Maybe you preferred me 
when I was in shit

625
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,920
because it made you feel better than me.

626
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,080
- Are you kidding? 
- No.

627
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,360
[rustling]

628
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,880
I don't know.

629
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,840
- Okay, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. 
- Sebastian?

630
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,400
- Yes? 
- It's good for you this evening, isn't it?

631
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,680
- What are you referring to? 
- At the 19:00.

632
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,640
For 'Mojo'. Are you there?

633
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,840
- I thought it was next Tuesday. 
- No, it's this evening.

634
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,320
Problems?

635
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,080
Give me the other camera! 
What's the problem?

636
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,240
The problem is this 
damn thing isn't working, here's what it is!

637
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,560
Okay, trumpet player, that's perfect.

638
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,080
Perfect! Magnificent! 
Okay, keyboard player. Look up.

639
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,880
Very well. Perfect, fantastic. 
Gorgeous. Okay, stop the music!

640
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:08,200
Wonderful. Gorgeous. Okay, now...

641
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,160
bite your lips like this, 
more or less like this,

642
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,480
like you were focusing 
on something, like, on your own track.

643
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,320
- Bite me what? 
- The lips. Bite your lips.

644
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,560
Okay.

645
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,080
Yes, perfect. 
Fantastic. Wonderful!

646
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,760
Gorgeous. 
Okay, now lower your glasses...

01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,400
on the nose... 
A little bit more, a little bit further down.

648
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,640
Keep your head down, but look 
up at me, a little sulky.

649
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,400
Yes! Awesome! Wonderful! 
Okay, turn on the keyboard!

650
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,840
- Do you want to hear the keyboard? 
- You don't have to bite your lips yet.

651
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,160
But yes, it does play something.

652
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,320
Play something. Whatever you want. 
You're a pianist, right? Play something.

653
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,040
Perfect, gorgeous. 
Magnificent. Good that way.

654
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:11,200
No, don't stop. Keep playing. 
Go ahead, continue. It was fantastic!

655
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,560
[Man] I've never seen anything more paltry.

656
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,160
[Man] He can't even act.

657
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,760
- [Man] And the window thing... 
- [Man 2] Yes, what did that mean?

658
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,880
[Man] But please, 
get a real job!

659
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,840
[Man] A disaster, female roles...

660
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,080
Mine!

661
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,200
Mia. I am so sorry.

662
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,920
Just tell me how it went.

663
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,600
- How did it go? 
- You're not helping me.

664
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,480
- Sorry, I was a dick. 
- Sorry, sorry, sorry...

665
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,720
- You can only say sorry. 
- I'll make up for it.

666
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,880
Let me fix it, okay?

667
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,920
- I understand you, if you don't want to... 
- It's over.

668
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,080
- What? 
- It's over.

669
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,600
What?

670
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:14,240
Everything. I'm done humiliating myself. 
I'm closed. Enough.

671
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,760
- Nobody came. 
- So what?

672
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,880
I can't pay for the theater. That's how it is...

673
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,120
- I'm going home for a while. 
- I'll come to see you tomorrow.

674
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,720
No, I'm going to my place.

675
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,720
- This is your house. 
- No, it's not anymore.

- [Donna] Hi, I'm looking for Mia Dolan.

681
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,320
- Try it on the cell phone. 
- [Woman] He's not answering,

682
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,160
- I thought it was there. 
- It's not here anymore.

683
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,160
- [Woman] In case you hear it... 
- I don't think so.

684
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,560
.. can you tell her that Jane from Amy Brandt
's casting is looking for her?

685
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,080
Casting?

687
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,920

689
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,440
[Man] Stop that thing!

[horn]

691
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:36,360
- Why did you come here? 
- I have good news.

692
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,280
- Which one? 
- Amy Brandt, the casting director...

693
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,720
- Yes? 
- He was at your show...

694
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,800
and she really liked it. 
She liked it so much...

695
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,240
Who wants to see you tomorrow for the audition 
for this...

696
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,400
great movie he has in his hands.

697
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,760
I'm not going there.

698
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,600
- I'm not going there. It would be... 
- How?

699
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,720
- No, that would be... 
- Excuse me?

700
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,160
It would kill me.

701
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,360
- What? 
- What? But what...? Shhh! Stop it!

702
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,880
- No! 
- Shhh! Lower your voice.

703
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,520
- The neighbors are here. 
- If you want me to be quiet,

704
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,600
You need to make fucking sense to me.

705
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,600
- Tell me why you won't go there. 
- Why not.

706
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,680
I've done a ton of auditions 
and the same things always happen:

707
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,600
I'm being interrupted 
because someone wants to have a sandwich!

708
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,200
Or, I'm crying 
and they start laughing!

709
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:30,320
Or are there other people in the 
waiting room... similar to me, but nicer

710
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,400
and better... 
Maybe because I'm not good!

711
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,920
- Yes, you are. 
- No.

712
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,480
- No, maybe that's not the case. 
- Yes, you are.

713
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,720
- Maybe they aren't. 
- You are.

714
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,560
Maybe I'm just one of those 
people who always wanted to do it...

715
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,560
but it's an unrealizable dream... for me. 
Do you know? When...

716
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:54,080
When you admit it, 
dreams change and so you grow.

717
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,520
Maybe I'm one of those people 
and I'm out of touch.

718
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,880
And I could go back to studying and look for 
something else that I'm good for,

719
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,480
since I left her... 
For this career

720
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,840
and six years have passed. 
I don't want to do it anymore.

721
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,480
Why?

722
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,320
- Why what? 
- Why don't you want to do it anymore?

723
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,200
Because I 
think it hurts a little too much.

724
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,560
- You are a child. 
- No, I'm trying to grow.

725
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,360
- You're crying like a child. 
- Oh, my God.

726
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:35,280
You have an audition tomorrow, at 5:30 p.m. 
I'll be out here at 8:00.

727
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,680
If you will be there too, out here, I 
don't know.

728
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,000
How did you find me?

729
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,080
The house in front of the library.

730
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,360
- I brought the coffee. 
- Well, great.

731
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,560
Mine?

732
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,880
Hi, Mia. 
I'm Amy and this is Frank.

733
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,120
- Hi. How are you? 
- A lot of pleasure.

734
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,880
- I'm happy to have found you. 
- Me too.

735
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:07,400
The film will be shot in Paris... 
and there's no script.

736
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:12,040
It will be almost all improvisation. 
We're going to build the character on the actress.

737
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,840
There will be three months of rehearsal 
and four months of shooting.

738
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,720
It's okay.

739
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,280
And we thought 
you could tell us a story.

740
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,800
- What kind? 
- You can tell anything.

741
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,640
- Anything? 
- Yes, tell a story.

742
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,360
You're a writer.

743
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,880
When you're ready.

744
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,400
My aunt lived in Paris.

745
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,720
I remember that, when he came home, he would tell 
us...

746
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,720
Some stories about living abroad and...

747
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:09,000
I remember... she told us that she had 
thrown herself into the Seine once.

748
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,720
Barefoot.

749
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,040
He was smiling.

750
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,680
When will you know?

751
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,240
In a couple of days, they said.

752
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,800
But I don't expect 
to know anything at all.

753
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,080
- You'll get it. 
- Most likely not.

754
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
- Yes, instead. 
- I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

755
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:08,440
I know. I know. I know a few things for you.

756
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,360
Where are we at?

757
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,840
- At Griffith Park. 
- Where are we... you and me?

758
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,560
I don't know.

759
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,320
What do we do?

760
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,280
I don't think we can do anything
, because when you get the part...

761
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,880
- If I'll get it. 
- When will you get it...

762
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,880
you'll have to commit to all of yourself.

763
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:46,000
- All of it. It's your dream. 
- What are you going to do?

764
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,800
I will follow my plans. I'm going to stay here 
and start my business.

765
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,320
You should go to Paris.

766
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,880
There's some good jazz there. 
And now you love jazz.

767
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,680
Right?

768
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,320
Yes.

769
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,160
Guess all we have to do 
is wait and see.

770
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,040
I will love you forever.

771
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,800
I will love you forever too.

772
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,280
But look at that view!

773
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,480
- I've seen better. 
- It's very ugly.

774
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,040
Yeah.

775
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,040
I've never been here during the day.

776
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,880
Hi. Could I have two iced coffees, 
please?

777
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,080
- Of course, right away. 
- It offers the house.

778
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,480
Oh, no, thanks. I'd like to pay.

779
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,240
Thank you.

780
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:27,240
It's okay. 
Harris did a good job.

781
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:31,640
- It took some time. 
- It's always like that. It's time for signatures.

782
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:37,480
- It's not bad at all, Seb. 
- “Not bad at all” is great.

783
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,040
- See you this evening. 
- See you this evening.

784

01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,200
- How did it go today? 
- Good.

- How is he? 
- Very good.

787
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,920
- Really? 
- Yes, come on.

788
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,320
Hi, baby!

789
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,760
I didn't think you were home already.

790
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
- Are you drawing? 
- Yes.

791
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:24,240
Can I help you? 
You know how much I like to draw.

792
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,160
Okay, Chelsea, we're going.

793
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,120
- Do you have everything? 
- We have everything.

794
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,520
- Do you need anything? 
- Hi, baby.

795
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,840
- Say, “Hi, mom.” 
- Sleep well.

796
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,240
- Hi, mom. 
- Have fun with Chelsea.

797
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,880
- Have fun. Hi, Mia. 
- Hi. Thank you so much.

798
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,280
Good night, girls. 
It was a pleasure.

799
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,280
- Good evening. 
- Hi.

800
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,320
My God!

801
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,360
What if we miss it? 
What are you going to tell Natalie?

802
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,120
- We'll see him again in New York. 
- Okay.

803
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,800
- [Mia] I don't miss this traffic. 
- I can see it badly.

804
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,160
Would you like to take this exit 
and go to dinner?

805
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,680
- Yes, of course. 
- Yes? Okay.

- Okay.
