1
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,760
"I am the way into the city of woe.

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,120
I am the way into eternal pain.

3
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,600
I am the way to go among the lost.

4
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,440
Before me, there were
no created things.

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,560
But those that last forever.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,240
As do I!

7
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,520
Abandon all hope you who are
about to enter here."

8
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,720
You are now in the presence...

9
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,640
of the motherfuckin' king!

10
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,080
You ready, John?

11
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Yeah.

12
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,400
Move! John Wick!

13
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
Mr. Wick.

14
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
To what do I owe the pleasure?

15
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
My ring.

16
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
My freedom.

17
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,320
Your ring is gone,

18
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,120
like The Elder before me.

19
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,520
And if you came here thinking
you could end this by killing me,

20
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
then you are mistaken.

21
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
My death will not change
the outcome any more

22
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,320
than you can change
your nature.

23
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,360
None of us
can escape who we are,

24
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,680
and no one escapes The Table.

25
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,240
And the only way John Wick
will ever have freedom or peace,

26
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,800
now or ever...

27
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,200
is in death.

28
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
I know.

29
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm afraid you've come
a very long way...

30
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,400
for nothing.

31
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
Yeah.

32
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Not really.

33
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,400
The Manager, please.

34
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,920
A Harbinger is here
to see you, sir.

35
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,080
This must be a mistake.

36
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,880
There is no mistake.

37
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,560
By order of the Marquis,
Vincent Bisset de Gramont,

38
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
this hotel
has been condemned.

39
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,080
You have one hour.

40
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,640
He is expecting you.

41
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,160
Can they do this, sir?

42
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,400
The decree is signed
by the 12 members of The Table,

43
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,360
giving the Marquis
the power of <i>autem imperator,</i>

44
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,920
which means he is
now our judge, jury and...

45
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Evacuate the hotel.

46
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,280
Ned Kelly's final words

47
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,760
as the hangman slipped the noose
around his neck were...

48
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,000
"Such is life."

49
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,480
"Such is life." Can you imagine
the acceptance, the defiance?

50
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,560
Today is not the day
you will die.

51
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Of that, I am sure.

52
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,320
You have the unshakeable faith of David,
my friend, but you shouldn't be here.

53
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,120
This will not be pleasant.

54
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,920
Such is life, sir.

55
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,520
My father used to say:

56
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,480
"How you do anything
is how you do everything."

57
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,920
Called it the first
and the last rule of life.

58
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,320
You believe in rules...

59
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Mr. Manager?

60
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
Oh, I do.

61
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,080
And what of consequences?

62
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
Of course.

63
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,240
And second chances.

64
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
That's where we differ,

65
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,120
you and I.

66
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,640
Second chances...

67
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,800
are the refuge of men who fail.

68
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,120
There are those on The Table

69
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,080
who blame this atrocity
on New York.

70
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,800
They believe it's this city.

71
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
The Table has indulged this
fucking place for too long.

72
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
And look where
that has gotten us.

73
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,240
I shot him.

74
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,360
And yet he lives,

75
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,520
polluting everything he touches.

76
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,080
Marquis, respectfully,
my hotel...

77
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,800
Your hotel?

78
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,680
If I might, sir?

79
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
By all means.

80
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,680
The Continentals
and their management

81
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,520
are a reminder to all who sit
beneath The Table

82
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,720
that none of us
are above the rules.

83
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,200
And yet we are here.

84
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,720
- Sir, Mr. Wick...
- We're not here because of John Wick!

85
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,560
He is simply the face
of your failure, Mr. Manager.

86
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,800
The sand in that glass is merely
an echo of my remaining patience.

87
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,000
You are no longer New York.

88
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,840
You are nothing.

89
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,240
You are Excommunicado.

90
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,640
And as such...

91
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,240
you no longer need
the services of a concierge.

92
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,000
It has been an honor...

93
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,640
my friend.

94
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
It should have been me.

95
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,880
Yes.

96
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
But it wasn't.

97
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,320
Now, you think about
why that is,

98
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,760
and perhaps one of us will have
benefited from this conversation.

99
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,480
Bring me Caine.

100
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,440
I have a name for you.

101
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,560
Respectfully,

102
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm retired.

103
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
Finished. Done.

104
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
I disagree.

105
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm no use to you.

106
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Or The Table.

107
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,600
That's not for you to decide.

108
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,280
I think you should
find someone else.

109
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,360
You came close.

110
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,560
Today.

111
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,680
Too close.

112
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,720
You put her in danger.

113
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,360
I know the deal I made.

114
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,560
A former associate, I believe.

115
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,880
He was.

116
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,880
And a friend.

117
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,520
The agreement with The Table
stays the same.

118
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,480
We give you a name,

119
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,000
you give us a life. Or...

120
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,200
we take one.

121
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,840
I will serve.

122
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,760
I will be of service.

123
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
Excellent!

124
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,120
I assume you have
a notion of where he might be?

125
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,160
John Wick has few friends
remaining in the world,

126
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,680
and even fewer he trusts

127
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
with his life.

128
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,600
Very, very good.

129
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,680
Welcome to the Osaka
Continental. How can I help?

130
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, I'm lookin' for a room.

131
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm afraid this facility
doesn't allow animals.

132
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Emotional support animal.

133
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,080
- She's your support animal?
- Other way round.

134
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm hers.
Isn't that right?

135
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,520
She stays in your room.

136
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,280
Enjoy your stay, sir.

137
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not too bad.

138
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,360
Not bad at all.

139
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,880
There is a dog in my lobby.

140
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,600
- Emotional support animal.
- Of course it is.

141
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,800
Tomorrow's schedule.

142
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,600
Mr. Suzuki at 11:00 and the Tarasovs
are requesting an audience at 2:00.

143
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,480
What's this at 8:00?

144
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Dinner with your daughter.

145
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,440
She says she's concerned
you've been working too hard.

146
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,320
What must I have done to deserve
such a considerate child?

147
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,320
- Good karma, I suppose.
- Indeed.

148
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,040
And how are our guests?

149
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,040
Some of our gold club members
are anxious.

150
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,360
It's always something.

151
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,200
And today it's New York.

152
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,200
- And my concierge?
- Concerned.

153
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,400
Perhaps we should get you
an emotional support animal.

154
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,240
Should we be worried?

155
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
We've done nothing to offend The Table.

156
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,240
Your relationship with Mr. Wick
is no secret. The Table will come.

157
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
And...

158
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,760
will be met with our grace.

159
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,720
Everything he touches dies.

160
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,280
Don't presume to tell me about a man
I've known longer...

161
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,240
than you've been alive.

162
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,840
Forgive me, Father.

163
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,320
Akira.

164
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,320
Please tell my daughter
that I look forward to our dinner.

165
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,160
Don't let anyone in.

166
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,280
I assume you are finally at peace.

167
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
Apparently not.

168
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,880
Killing the Elder
was a mistake, my friend.

169
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,200
Their response was the destruction
of the New York Continental.

170
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,040
My daughter fears we are next.

171
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,480
- Winston?
- Alive,

172
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,360
but they executed his concierge

173
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,120
to prove a point.

174
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,320
Have you given any thought to...

175
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,520
where this ends?

176
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,120
The Table will never stop.

177
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,880
You know this.

178
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,760
It only takes life

179
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
and only gives death.

180
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,200
Koji...

181
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,200
For troubling you like this...
I'm sorry.

182
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,360
Friendship means little
when it's convenient.

183
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,880
Welcome to the Osaka
Continental. How can I help?

184
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
The manager.

185
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,560
<i>Por favor.</i>

186
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,320
Of course.

187
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,680
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

188
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,320
Please evacuate everyone... discreetly.

189
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,520
The only path
this leads to is death.

190
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,320
I'm going to kill them all.

191
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,080
I believe you'll try.

192
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,120
But no one,

193
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,600
not even you,
can kill everyone.

194
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,040
You want to die?

195
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,040
That's your choice.

196
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,560
A good death

197
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,160
only comes after a good life.

198
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,840
You and I left a good life behind
a long time ago, my friend.

199
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,920
Father, The High Table.

200
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,120
What is he doing here?

201
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,040
Mr. Wick is our guest.

202
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,120
Father...

203
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,560
I'll talk to them.
They don't know you're here.

204
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,240
Please.

205
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,280
Stay with Mr. Wick.

206
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,560
Guests have arrived...
be ready to show hospitality.

207
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,920
Welcome to the Osaka
Continental, gentlemen.

208
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
How may I be of service?

209
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,080
The Table has reason to believe that
this facility is providing services...

210
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,400
To one who is...
EXCOMMUNICATED

211
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,880
That is a grave accusation.

212
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,240
We will require full access
to your hotel.

213
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,200
Of course.

214
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
But as you are well aware,
no business,

215
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
not even your kind
of business,

216
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,600
may be conducted
on Continental grounds.

217
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,720
So,

218
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm going to have to ask you
to surrender your firearms.

219
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,400
We speak for the Marquis.

220
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,400
And I speak for Osaka.

221
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,560
Your guns,

222
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,000
please.

223
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,200
Don't repeat the mistake
that fool in New York made.

224
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,800
Fools talk, cowards are silent,

225
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,040
but wise men listen.

226
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,440
So which one will you be?

227
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,360
Hello, old friend.

228
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,800
So good of you to visit
after all these years.

229
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,200
- You are with them now?
- No.

230
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
- No.
- Your daughter?

231
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,560
Mia?

232
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,480
Alive.

233
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,760
And your daughter Akira?

234
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
Well.

235
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,680
I'm glad.

236
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,200
You know...

237
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,400
we don't have
to end this with blood.

238
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,640
Then leave.

239
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,280
No one defies The Table.
I remember once you understood that.

240
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,600
And I remember a time when you understood
the meaning of brotherhood.

241
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
Enough!

242
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,440
By order of
the Marquis de Gramont,

243
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,840
this hotel has
been deconsecrated.

244
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
Step aside.

245
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,560
Don't do this, Koji.

246
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,840
I'm sorry.

247
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,800
KILL THEM ALL!

248
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,720
Get out.

249
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,080
Fall back.

250
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,080
Secure the hotel.

251
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,880
Find Wick.

252
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,920
You have no right to be here.

253
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,320
If they find you here,
The Table will kill my father,

254
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,520
me...

255
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,800
everyone, because
you broke the rules.

256
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,880
You shouldn't have come.

257
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,120
The hotel is being attacked.

258
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,160
You armed?

259
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
Let's go.

260
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,400
STOP THEM

261
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Hey!

262
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,480
Blind man!

263
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,040
Do your job!

264
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Akira!

265
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,560
Can you stand?

266
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,160
Get out the way
you came.

267
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,480
- Go to the Umeda Station.
- I'll stay.

268
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,280
Don't insult my gift to you.

269
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,600
And, John, do me
a small courtesy.

270
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,480
Kill as many as you can.

271
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,160
John?

272
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,680
Caine.

273
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,640
They gave you my name.

274
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

275
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,280
Me, too.

277
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
You should have stayed out.

278
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,120
For all our sakes.

279
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,720
I tried.

280
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,200
Did you?

281
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,080
Come on, John.

282
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,480
Let's get this shit over with.

283
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,200
Yeah.

284
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,840
That sounds like a good idea.

285
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,000
You took a deal.

286
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,760
Same as you, John.

287
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,400
Family?

288
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,520
Family.

289
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,000
You dead, John?

290
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,680
John.

291
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,640
Caine.

292
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,080
Damn, Johnny.

293
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,880
This is quite the mess
you've made.

294
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,640
I don't know you.

295
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,240
But I know you.

296
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,600
You a tracker?

297
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,640
How much?

298
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,120
Not enough.

299
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,000
But it's gettin' there.

300
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,600
I need you to take better care
of yourself, Johnny.

301
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,720
'Cause we're
in this together now.

302
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,640
All right, Koji.

303
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Just tell me where John is
and get out of here.

304
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,480
Leave.

305
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,880
Go somewhere far away.

306
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,280
You know I won't.

307
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,880
You've been shot?

308
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,360
You owe John Wick nothing.

309
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,440
He has no marker on you.

310
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,560
You must have fallen far
to believe

311
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,840
the only debts we have...

312
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,520
lie in markers.

313
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,920
Come on.

314
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,880
I don't want to do this.

315
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,240
Father!

316
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,440
Look at me.

317
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,080
Even a blind man knows
you have lost.

318
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,560
And, Caine,

319
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,760
you don't need eyes
to see the right path.

320
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,320
Just take care
of your daughter.

321
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,840
I...

322
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,040
I am.

323
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,280
No!

324
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,800
Don't.

325
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,760
Live.

326
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,600
I'll be waiting for you.

327
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,360
Who is he?

328
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,000
He was a friend.

329
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,440
My father is dead
because of you.

330
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,360
Because of what you did.

331
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,160
So either you kill him...

332
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,440
or I will.

333
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,320
I understand.

334
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,920
Goodbye...

335
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,080
Mr. Wick.

336
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,320
Thanks for coming.

337
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,280
Well, us homeless folk do have
to stick together now, don't we?

338
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,240
I need to speak to him.

339
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,920
Last time you spoke to him,

340
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,760
you shot him off a roof.

341
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,440
I had no choice.

342
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,840
They held all the cards.

343
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,160
No.

344
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,640
But who held the gun?

345
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,560
John needs to know the breadth
of what's coming at him.

346
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,440
This Marquis is unrestrained.
The Table have let him off the leash.

347
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,440
Oh, my dear Winston,
your benevolence is touching!

348
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,600
But tell me. Tell me true.

349
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,800
Why did the Frenchman
let you live?

350
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,080
Killing a man can turn him
into a martyr.

351
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,760
Letting him live...

352
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,240
tells the world he's a coward
or a turncoat.

353
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,520
So what are you?

354
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,560
Aggrieved.

355
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,240
I fail to see how laying waste
to Continentals

356
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,000
is getting you closer
to killing John Wick.

357
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,400
This campaign
is not to kill John Wick.

358
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,080
It is to kill the idea of John Wick.

359
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,240
And to do that,

360
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,400
I must destroy everything
that idea touches.

361
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,080
The bloodshed in Osaka
was not necessary.

362
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,600
The bloodshed was the point.

363
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,520
He'll make it your choice.

364
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,080
You, come with me.

365
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,760
Think twice before accepting.

366
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,920
And you are?

367
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,720
Nobody.

368
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,920
Coyness,

369
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,800
Mr. Nobody,

370
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,320
is a pathetic trait.

371
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,080
A miscalculation,

372
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,400
in which by trying
to hide our ego,

373
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,320
we let it appear
stark naked.

374
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,200
I will ask only once.

375
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,560
How were you able
to locate him?

376
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,320
Pay and I'll tell you.

377
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,240
How much would such a service
be worth?

378
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,360
Twenty-five million,

379
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,720
plus a matching contribution
to my 401k

380
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,800
when he's dead.

381
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,320
We found him once.

382
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
We'll find him again.

383
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,840
Is that before or after he puts you
in the ground?

384
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,920
I like you.

385
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,080
20 million.

386
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,560
Like me some more.

387
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,000
23.

388
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,400
Ego...

389
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,320
Mr. Nobody.

390
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,520
It's 23.

391
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,240
You clearly can afford it.

392
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,880
For the service.

393
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,200
Fuck!

394
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,600
No, no, no. No.

395
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,280
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.
Sit. Sit.

396
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,640
What the fuck is this, man?

397
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,120
A choice.

398
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,880
You can pull the knife out
or you can pull your hand out.

399
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,480
One shows me a man committed
only to himself,

400
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,000
and the other...

401
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,200
a man committed
to the cause.

402
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,520
Which one are you?

403
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,120
Happy hunting

404
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,720
Winston.

405
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,600
Jonathan.

406
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,440
My condolences.

407
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,440
He was a good man.

408
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,080
Yes, he was.

409
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,760
Taken for our sins.

410
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,120
Who is this?

411
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,760
The Marquis de Gramont.

412
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,680
Elevated only by his guarantee
of killing you.

413
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,000
All the resources of The Table
are at his disposal.

414
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,080
Where do I find him?

415
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,120
Paris.

416
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,440
Where will it end?

417
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,320
With him dead.

418
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,320
And then?

419
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,200
Have you learned nothing?

420
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,440
They will replace him
before the body's cold.

421
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,200
Hercules had his Hydra.
You have The Table,

422
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,680
except you'll run out of bullets
before they run out of heads.

423
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,680
Kill him, but do it the smart way.

424
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,800
And get him to give you
your freedom.

425
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,320
How?

426
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,280
Turn his rules and consequences
against him.

427
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,040
Challenge him to single combat.

428
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,720
High Table duels are a myth.

429
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,240
Wrong!

430
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,240
They're a cold hard fact,

431
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,520
and part of the foundation
of The Table

432
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,240
to stop its more combustible members
from outright war.

433
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,520
It's also, win or lose...

434
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,760
what you say you want...

435
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,840
a way out.

436
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,280
I don't sit at The Table.

437
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,040
Your family does.

438
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:34,000
Get them to issue the challenge
and then offer you up as proxy.

439
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,320
I don't have a family.

440
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,320
The Ruska Roma tore my ticket.

441
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,480
Then I suggest you get your ass
to Berlin...

442
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,840
and get it mended.

443
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,440
Or...

444
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,480
pick a plot.

445
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,320
What do you get
out of this, Winston?

446
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,840
What you were so good
at getting, Jonathan.

447
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,880
Revenge.

448
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,480
Cool revolver...

449
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,600
Vintage.

450
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,200
Everything?

451
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,600
Father...

452
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,720
Yes, my son?

453
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,520
I need to speak to Uncle Pyotr.

454
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,880
Nice suit.

455
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,600
Speak.

456
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,840
He's in Berlin,
at the Ruska Roma.

457
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,920
<i>You can wire</i>
<i>that finder's fee now.</i>

458
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,240
No.

459
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,120
<i>Excuse me?</i>

460
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,200
Kill John and you'll get
your money.

461
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,200
That wasn't part of our deal.

462
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,480
The deal was for your service.

463
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,720
And it's now a life for a life,
Mr. Nobody.

464
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,600
<i>Yours...</i>

465
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,680
<i>or his.</i>

466
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,640
When it's done,
you will have your prize.

467
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,160
And your pension.

468
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,640
Asshole.

469
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,280
The prodigal son returns...

470
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,360
But this isn't your home anymore, is it...

471
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,160
Jonathan Wick?

472
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,160
You grew up, Katia.

473
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,840
And you got old.
Then again, it's been a while.

474
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,560
I need to talk to him.

475
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,760
You are forgetting...

476
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,120
we are still under The Table.

477
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,400
And last I checked...

478
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,640
you are Excommunicado
and your ticket...

479
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,040
was torn.

480
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,280
You have no business with us.

481
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,360
That's for Pyotr to decide.

482
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,520
Pyotr is dead!

483
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,160
After you...

484
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,800
put a bullet
in The Elder's head...

485
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,120
the Marquis had one
put in Pyotr's.

486
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,720
And in fine
Russian tradition...

487
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,480
He sent us the bill.

488
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,520
Because of you,

489
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,680
I had to kneel in front of the man
who murdered my father.

490
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,600
Then we have
a common enemy.

491
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,160
We can help each other.

492
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,360
You can't even help yourself.

493
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,840
How the hell are you going
to help us?

494
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,120
By killing this Marquis.

495
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,520
They just appoint another.

496
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,160
His death changes NOTHING

497
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,480
It does
if I kill him in a duel!

498
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,760
The Old Ways are clear
on the matter...

499
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,360
but for a duel to be sanctioned
by The Table...

500
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,440
he would need to be a member
of a family...

501
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,000
and have a CREST.

502
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,760
How many did you kill to get out?

503
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,680
A lot.

504
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,840
You will only have to kill one
to get back in.

505
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,120
The bastard who
murdered my father.

506
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,040
Give me the name.

507
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,840
Killa Harkan.

508
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,200
You will find him
at Himmel and Hölle.

509
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,880
When he's dead,

510
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,480
- I will mend your ticket.
- And the Crest?

511
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,480
Harkan first, then we talk.

512
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,560
Bring proof of death.

513
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,840
I'll need a way in.

514
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,120
I know a way.

515
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,400
Klaus will take you.

516
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,520
I am Klaus.

517
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,920
- John.
- I am Klaus.

518
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,920
Please tell your mistress
that I am honored by this gesture

519
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,880
and I look forward to
our continuing partnership.

520
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,640
I am Klaus.

521
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,160
Mr. John Wick...

522
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,080
in the flesh.

523
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,640
The Baba Yaga.

524
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,520
Must be Christmas, ja?

525
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,520
Where are my manners? Please.

526
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,680
A drink, Mr. Wick?

527
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,840
You were expecting me.

528
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,080
Not me.

529
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,400
Him.

530
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,600
John?

531
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,280
How are you?

532
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,640
- You knew I'd be here.
- I suspected it.

533
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,840
Family.

534
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,440
That family sold you out, Mr. Wick.

535
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,520
They gave you up

536
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,080
in the vain hope
of saving themselves.

537
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,760
You see, that's why
I never trust the Cossacks. They are...

538
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,480
dirty people.

539
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,520
This is personal.

540
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,000
I sense tension here.

541
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,760
Mr. Wick may probably feel...

542
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,560
I'm responsible
for the death of a...

543
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,800
mutual friend.

544
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,920
But I didn't kill Koji.

545
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,400
You did, John.

546
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,720
You know, this discord
between old friends...

547
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,840
it saddens me.

548
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,040
Allow me to help.

549
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,840
We have a deal.

550
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,080
Had.

551
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,360
The Marquis...

552
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,080
Hell, I doubt he'll mind if it's bullets,
blades or a blind man.

553
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,320
We found someone outside.

554
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,760
Is this for me, Mr...

555
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,040
Nobody.

556
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,200
And, no, it's actually
for him.

557
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,840
Then take a seat,
Mr. Nobody.

558
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,520
Exciting, ja?

559
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,800
So...

560
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,640
you want to kill him.

561
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,640
You want to kill him.

562
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,520
I want to kill him.

563
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,360
What about you, Mr. Wick?

564
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,920
I'm going to kill you.

565
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,920
For Pyotr. Of course, ja.

566
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,040
But it looks like
we have ourselves...

567
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,400
a genuine conundrum.

568
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,920
A quandary, if you will.
A real-life dilemma.

569
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,880
So...

570
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,680
How about we play a game?

571
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,160
One hand.

572
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,280
The winner decides who lives...

573
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,520
and who does not.

574
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,840
All right.

575
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,680
What's the buy-in?

576
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,080
More than you can afford.

577
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,880
Yeah, I'm one bullet away
from being a very rich man.

578
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,880
Or a dead one.

579
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,840
Five-card draw.

580
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,440
Mr. Wick.

581
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,280
Mr. Wick?

582
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,680
Dead man's hand, Mr. Wick.

583
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,840
Well...

584
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,720
I don't gamble.

585
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,480
Let's see.

586
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,160
Four nines.

587
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,440
And a four.

588
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,120
Most impressive.

589
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,720
Royal flush.

590
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,920
Pretty good for a nobody.

591
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,200
Thank you.

592
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,920
A blind man,
a guy with a dog...

593
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,880
and John Wick walk into a bar
and take a seat at the table.

594
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,640
That either sounds like the beginning
of a stupendous joke

595
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,280
or a most
profitable opportunity.

596
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,400
One...

597
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,480
thinks he can serve his way out.

598
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,200
One...

599
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,640
thinks he can buy his way out.

600
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,000
And one...

601
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,160
thinks he can kill...

602
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,560
his way out.

603
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,120
Each of them all think
that they have the winning hand.

604
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,320
But what they fail to realize...

605
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,080
is that the moment they took
a seat at The Table...

606
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,080
they had already lost.

607
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,840
Let me guess.
Five of a kind?

608
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,760
Yeah.

609
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,840
I knew you were a cheating prick.

610
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah, total prick.

611
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,560
Just so you know,

612
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,880
Pyotr wasn't personal.

613
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,360
Now, maybe a little bit.

614
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,600
Kill!

615
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,440
LIGHTS OUT
ASSHOLES

616
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,840
Hey! He's over there!

617
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,400
YOU SHOT ME IN THE ASS!

618
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,480
BASTARD!

619
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,800
Nuts!

620
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,720
Know what your problem is,
Mr. Wick?

621
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,800
You are unlucky.

622
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,680
Unlucky in life,

623
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,680
in love,

624
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,560
in friendship.

625
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,240
And now...

626
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,840
in death.

627
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,160
Why don't you just die?

628
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,080
He's mine.

629
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,120
I told you not to take a deal.

630
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,640
Yeah, I guess your deal didn't
work out either, huh?

631
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,880
Hell of a thing for them to take
your eyes, though.

632
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,560
They didn't take them.

633
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,120
I gave them.

634
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,200
You are a child of the Belarus...

635
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,920
an orphan of our tribe...

636
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,800
You are bound to us as we are to you...

637
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,040
in this life and the next.

638
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,160
Your blood... is my blood.

639
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:18,400
Your pain... is my pain.

640
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,840
Your life... is my life.

641
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,600
Welcome back, Jardani.

642
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,720
The Ruska Roma will support
your challenge.

643
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,400
Who will be your Second?

644
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,040
A warning
of the cost of tyranny.

645
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,080
You must intend
to join your concierge.

646
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,160
Not today.

647
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,360
Per the Old Ways and the old laws,
John Wick calls you to a duel.

648
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,760
To settle your differences
the old-fashioned way,

649
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,720
as gentlemen should.

650
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,600
You speak of the Old Ways
as if you know them.

651
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,320
A man of Mr. Wick's station
cannot issue such a challenge.

652
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,080
He has his family's crest.

653
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,880
Berlin.

654
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,760
Ruska Roma challenge,
the acceptance of Mr. Wick

655
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,840
back into the fold, it's all there.

656
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,160
Recorded history now.

657
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:37,640
And why would I accept this
from a second-rate seat?

658
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,280
Because there are rules,
and without them...

659
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,360
- We live with the animals.
- Exactly.

660
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,320
Times are changing.

661
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,240
A new day is dawning.

662
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,400
New ideas, new rules,

663
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,880
new management.

664
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,080
Yet you will accept.

665
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:03,680
Because we all still sit
beneath The Table.

666
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,360
Even you are not immune
to the consequences of failure.

667
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,280
And what exactly
are Mr. Wick's terms?

668
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,160
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

669
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,120
The unconditional release
of any and all obligations

670
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,800
to The Table.

671
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:46,200
Ah, history is littered with Marquis who
were only remembered by their servants.

672
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,080
But you...

673
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,920
you could be remembered as the man
who brought John Wick,

674
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:58,320
the most feared of all by The Table
and all who sit at it, into the light.

675
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,160
Your light.

676
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,400
And who could predict

677
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:09,520
how high that kind of glory
could take a man in our world?

678
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,440
Noon, <i>La Tour Eiffel.</i>

679
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,000
To discuss rules.

680
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,320
You may go.

681
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,440
When I'm done.

682
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,360
As his Second, upon his victory,

683
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,080
my Excommunicado
is to be lifted, my title restored,

684
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,080
my hotel rebuilt
and re-consecrated,

685
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,320
all at The Table's expense.

686
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,680
Of course.

687
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,680
I am impressed.

688
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,600
How you do anything
is how you do everything.

689
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,880
Now I'm done.

690
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,800
I think I'll miss you
when you're gone.

691
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,840
Shame I can't say the same.

692
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,240
You don't know, do you?

693
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,560
What's that?

694
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,200
A man's Second,
like his sponsor,

695
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,680
either walks out with his champion
or is buried beside him.

696
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,920
The Old Ways.

697
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,440
Such is life.

698
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,120
Under the Old Laws,

699
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,560
only one can survive.

700
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,680
Do you both understand that?

701
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,720
Very good.

702
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,120
Rules.

703
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,560
The Challenged chooses first.

704
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,880
Time?

705
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,680
Sunrise.

706
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,440
Now.

707
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,680
Sunrise.

708
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,560
Location?

709
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:04,520
You come here thinking there is
a way out of this world for you, Mr. Wick?

710
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,920
There is not.

711
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,440
<i>Le Centre Pompidou.</i>

712
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,840
<i>Sacré Coeur.</i>

713
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,920
<i>Sacré Coeur.</i>

714
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,360
Weapons?

715
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,600
If you win,

716
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,720
The Table will honor its word.

717
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,400
You will have your freedom.

718
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,080
But you won't take it.

719
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,160
Blades.

720
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,400
Pistols.

721
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,920
Dueling pistols.

722
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,360
Thirty paces.

723
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,840
In the event that
both parties survive,

724
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:59,560
each will approach the other
at increments of ten paces

725
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,840
until only one remains.

726
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,040
Rules of engagement.

727
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,400
No quarter.

728
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,120
You know why you won't take
your freedom?

729
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,600
Because this is who you are,

730
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,280
who you've always been.

731
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,200
You are a killer.

732
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,040
An orphan we plucked from the street
and honed into a knife.

733
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,320
And it is the killing
that gives you purpose.

734
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,400
A man without purpose...

735
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,520
is nothing.

736
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,280
No quarter.

737
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,320
No quarter.

738
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,200
If there is nothing else, gentlemen,

739
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,280
- I will see...
- A nomination.

740
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,000
It is his right.

741
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,440
Do you have a name?

742
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,720
Caine.

743
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,400
So be it.

744
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,120
Sunrise, <i>Sacré Coeur.</i>

745
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,760
Dueling pistols,
no quarter.

746
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,240
Should Mr. Wick be victorious,

747
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,760
he will be free of any and all obligation
to The High Table,

748
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,480
and his Second will be reinstated

749
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,400
as the manager of the rebuilt
New York Continental.

750
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:34,240
Should the Marquis Vincent Bisset
de Gramont be victorious...

751
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,120
John Wick will be dead.

752
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,880
As will his Second.

753
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,040
Just so.

754
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:47,160
Now, if there is nothing more, gentlemen,
I will see you at sunrise.

755
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,000
Failure to meet at the appointed hour

756
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,640
will result in forfeiture
and immediate execution.

757
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:06,640
There is no John out there.

758
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,080
No happy husband
with a normal life.

759
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,120
There's only John Wick...

760
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,480
the killer.

761
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,560
And he's going to kill you.

762
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,240
<i>Your hotel?</i>

763
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,360
Yes.

764
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,720
You always have
an angle, don't you?

765
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,240
Doesn't everyone?

766
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,920
Let's find safe harbor
before it starts.

767
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,280
There's something
I need to do first.

768
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,880
Sooner rather than later.

769
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,120
Won't do it.

770
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,040
You fight your own fight.

771
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,760
Isn't this what you want?

772
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,800
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

773
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,880
You kill him,
and you and your daughter will be free.

774
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,600
No one can touch her.

775
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,280
If you don't...

776
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,800
she will have to face
the consequences.

777
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,280
The choice is yours.

778
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,040
Caine.

779
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,000
John.

780
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,680
Saying goodbyes?

781
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,200
Saying hello.

782
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,440
You think your wife
can hear you?

783
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,800
No.

784
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,920
Then why bother?

785
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,360
Maybe I'm wrong.

786
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,080
The dead are gone.

787
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,400
Only the living matter.

788
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,000
After my daughter was born...

789
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,800
I wanted to leave this life.

790
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,520
I thought I did.

791
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:44,240
But you didn't.

792
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,040
We're damned...

793
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,200
you and I.

794
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,600
On that we agree.

795
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:00,560
My daughter's not.

796
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,160
If it's between you and her...

797
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,600
you're going to die.

798
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,040
Maybe not.

799
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,080
I missed you, John.

800
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:29,560
It's so good to sit with a friend.

801
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

802
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,240
This is how you
resolve the situation?

803
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,720
Duello with the Baba Yaga.

804
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,240
Failure will shake the foundation
of The High Table,

805
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,600
and it will turn Wick into a saint.

806
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,200
My victory will do the opposite.

807
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,680
Marquis de Gramont!

808
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,280
A man's ambition...

809
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,040
should never exceed his worth.

810
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,880
You would do well
to remember that, sir.

811
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,520
<i>Bonjour,</i> Monsieur Wick.

812
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,520
And welcome to <i>La Resistance.</i>

813
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,600
A little far from home,
aren't you?

814
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:12,800
Well, your little act of uncivil
disobedience inspired me, John.

815
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,080
I'm branching out,
spreading my wings.

816
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,600
How goes the Grand
Farewell Tour?

817
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,160
Coming to an end.

818
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,360
So it seems. So it seems.

819
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,280
Forty-two regular, wasn't it?

820
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,120
It's Kevlar, front to back.
The latest in ballistic chic.

821
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,920
Appropriate for
all formal occasions.

822
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,680
Weddings, funerals,
High Table duels.

823
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:41,520
After all, a man has to look his best
when it's time to get married.

824
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,080
Or buried.

825
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,920
Forgive me, sir...

826
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,240
but this is madness.

827
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,640
Madness?

828
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,240
Trusting your fate to a blind man?

829
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,080
There are three types
of men in this world.

830
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:11,400
Those who have something
to live for,

831
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,520
those who have something
to die for,

832
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,440
and those who have something
to kill for.

833
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,200
John Wick has none
of these things.

834
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,840
He is but a ghost
in search of a graveyard.

835
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,680
But the blind man...

836
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,720
well, he has all three.

837
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,360
Besides, I have a feeling
Mr. Wick

838
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:37,600
will never make it
to the duel by sunrise.

839
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,240
Understood, sir...

840
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,160
All right, now.

841
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:27,040
For all you boppers out there
in the City of Lights,

842
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,080
for all you street people
with an ear for the action...

843
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,560
<i>to all my loyal listeners</i>
<i>who know the beat of the street...</i>

844
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,840
<i>tonight is your chance</i>
<i>to make some beautiful music.</i>

845
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,760
I've been asked
to relay a special request...

846
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:46,400
<i>from a secret admirer.</i>

847
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:51,880
<i>It seems there's a thorn</i>
<i>in our little slice of paradise.</i>

848
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,760
<i>A wicked man from the Big Apple</i>

849
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:58,240
<i>is making a beeline</i>
<i>to our sacred heart.</i>

850
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:04,080
<i>We are putting the call out to deliver</i>
<i>your hardest beats to this man in black.</i>

851
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:08,680
<i>If you want the prize,</i>
<i>you must finish before sunrise.</i>

852
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:11,200
This golden oldie,

853
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,280
and I do mean golden hit,

854
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,920
goes out to you, Mr. Wick.

855
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,840
And remember...

856
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,040
there is nowhere to run.

857
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:33,160
<i>I want to thank you all</i>
<i>for listening to W-U-X-I-A,</i>

858
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:38,120
<i>the place for all your entertainment</i>
<i>and informational needs.</i>

859
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,320
<i>Good hunting.</i>

860
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,040
And so it begins.

861
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:47,360
I'm going to need a gun.

862
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,320
I thought you'd never ask.

863
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,560
Nine-millimeter Pit Viper.

864
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,680
How'd you get this?

865
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:59,200
I know a guy who knows a guy
who shot a guy.

866
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:03,120
Twenty-one round capacity magazine
with a built-in compensator

867
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,000
for virtually no muzzle flip.

868
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,920
Fiber-optic front sight,

869
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,720
ambidextrous safeties,

870
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,240
flared magwell for faster reloads,

871
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:13,240
two-pound extreme trigger,

872
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,520
and for those more,
how shall we say,

873
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,440
intimate encounters,

874
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,800
this Viper has
ferocious fucking fangs.

875
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,560
How close can you
get me to the church?

876
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,240
Amen.

877
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,680
Here we are, gentlemen.

878
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:50,360
Your ride.

879
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:58,440
When I advised you not to dip your pinky
back into this pond,

880
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,280
I didn't think I'd get wet.

881
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,720
It'll all be over after today.

882
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,920
When I was burying Charon,

883
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,040
I was torn about what to put
on his gravestone.

884
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,080
A few words to sum up
an entire life?

885
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,800
"Long live the king!"

886
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,560
Had mine made years ago.

887
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,120
Modest.

888
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,640
Prophetic.

889
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,720
What did you decide?

890
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,880
"Friend."

891
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,480
That's what he was
above all else.

892
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,200
A friend.

893
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,840
<i>Au revoir et bonne chasse,</i>
<i>Monsieur Wick.</i>

894
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,880
Thank you, King.

895
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,880
Jonathan.

896
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,240
Winston.

897
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:03,480
Sunrise is at 6:03.

898
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,520
Don't be late for all our sakes, hm?

899
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:18,080
"Loving husband."

900
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,920
That's what I want on mine.

901
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,840
"John. Loving husband."

902
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,000
Confirmed.

903
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:00,520
Good news, boppers.
We have a sighting.

904
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:06,160
<i>Our man in black has been spotted</i>
<i>in the Septième Arrondissement.</i>

905
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:09,880
<i>I think it's high time</i>
<i>we paint him red.</i>

906
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:16,240
It seems like our friends at the guild
dropped the ball,

907
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:19,560
<i>and now it's rolling</i>
<i>to the Arc de Triomphe.</i>

908
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:21,520
<i>Let's see who picks it up.</i>

909
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:29,880
<i>Come on now, people.</i>
We're gonna have to do a lot better.

910
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:36,880
<i>Now, who's gonna be</i>
<i>our big winner?</i>

911
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,360
Who is this?

912
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,080
You know, the question you should be
asking is: "How much?"

913
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,680
I think we have
the situation under control.

914
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:21,640
Because the way I see it,

915
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:25,440
<i>is that if Mr. Johnny Boy makes</i>
<i>it to the church on time,</i>

916
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:28,120
this could be your
last night as Marquis.

917
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:43,160
<i>A little traffic update.</i>

918
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,240
<i>I'm hearing the boys in black</i>
<i>couldn't get it done.</i>

919
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,800
<i>Our wicked friend</i>
<i>is on the move again.</i>

920
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:53,440
He's headed your way,
my listeners of the 8th.

921
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,040
Yes?

922
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,440
Fine.

923
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,600
You have a deal.

924
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:02,440
All right. 35 it is.

925
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:04,840
That wasn't our deal.

926
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,080
Well, that's the only deal
being offered today.

927
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:37,000
Get him!

928
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:46,320
Phone!

929
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:51,800
What?

930
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:54,120
- Now, you listen to me.
<i>- Forty.</i>

931
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:58,160
You pay for the service.

932
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:01,680
Fine.

933
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:12,480
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

934
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,240
The lottery just went up.

935
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:20,000
<i>To all you boppers</i>
<i>still sitting on the side,</i>

936
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:23,880
<i>Mr. Wick has the church in sight.</i>

937
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,800
<i>We are almost out of time.</i>

938
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:30,320
<i>Last chance to win the prize</i>

939
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:33,520
<i>before Mr. Wick's last sunrise.</i>

940
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:38,600
<i>So who out there is going</i>
<i>to climb those 222 steps?</i>

941
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:47,800
<i>Good luck.</i>

942
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:20,600
It appears Mr. Wick
won't be joining us.

943
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:40,480
John?

944
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:44,280
John?

945
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:47,400
Caine.

946
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,600
What time is sunrise?

947
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:53,880
Two...

948
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,560
maybe three minutes.

949
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:01,160
I need you to get to the top
of those stairs, John.

950
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:06,480
Yeah.

951
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:14,840
Ready?

952
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:16,720
Yeah.

953
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:37,200
Twelve or nine?

954
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,280
Nine.

955
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:14,760
- Six upstairs.
- Thanks.

956
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,560
<i>Ciao, ciao,</i> Mr. Wick.

957
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:45,880
You can't shoot me.

958
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:51,880
Yeah, you're right.

959
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:53,560
But I can shoot him.

960
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:07,400
But I can hit you...

961
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,320
motherfucker.

962
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:11,600
Let's go, John.

963
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:28,520
Shit.

964
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:38,240
Nuts.

965
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:48,840
You hit my puppy.

966
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:07,040
You know, you owe me.

967
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,160
Yeah.

968
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,280
Nothing personal, John.

969
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:21,920
We're even now.

970
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:24,200
Yeah.

971
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:16,440
And so we begin.

972
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:40,280
We seek the truth and will endure
the consequences.

973
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:43,160
Consequences.

974
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:04,240
Go on now. Come on.

975
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,760
Positions, gentlemen.

976
02:25:57,560 --> 02:26:00,120
See you in the next life,
brother.

977
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:03,800
Thirty paces.

978
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:54,520
- Remember your daughter.
- Fuck off!

979
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:04,640
What a beautiful sunrise.

980
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:26,080
Last words, Winston?

981
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:29,160
Just have fun out there.

982
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,160
Are you ready, Mr. Caine?

983
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:02,880
Mr. Wick?

984
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:17,600
I commend your souls to God.

985
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:20,160
We begin as we end.

986
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:22,480
Ashes to ashes,

987
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:26,000
dust to dust.

988
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:28,480
Fire!

989
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:50,840
Twenty paces!

990
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:25,880
Fire!

991
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:38,840
Nice.

992
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:48,400
Ten paces!

993
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,760
Just kill him.

994
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:02,000
Those who cling to death...

995
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:04,640
live.

996
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:09,680
Those who cling to life...

997
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:11,880
die.

998
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:23,320
Fire!

999
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:01,760
Stop!

1000
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:03,520
As your sponsor...

1001
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,920
I claim the <i>coup de grace.</i>

1002
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:13,600
Your weapon, give it to me.

1003
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,360
Is my daughter free now?

1004
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:19,840
<i>Oui.</i> You and your daughter.

1005
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:21,480
Enjoy.

1006
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:40,840
Rules.

1007
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:45,600
You arrogant asshole.

1008
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:48,400
He didn't shoot.

1009
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:50,600
Consequences.

1010
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:08,720
That's fucking good.

1011
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:31,560
Your obligation to The Table...

1012
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:36,640
is satisfied, John Wick.
You are free.

1013
02:33:42,040 --> 02:33:44,480
As are you
and your daughter, sir.

1014
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:50,200
You will be fully reinstated,
Mr. Manager.

1015
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:52,600
All of your terms...

1016
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,800
will be fulfilled.

1017
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:04,200
Our business here now
is concluded.

1018
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:06,280
Good day.

1019
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:48,600
My brother.

1020
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:53,760
You owe me one.

1021
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,200
Yeah.

1022
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:20,840
Winston.

1023
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:22,760
Jonathan.

1024
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,680
Will you take me home?

1025
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:36,280
Of course.

1026
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:10,840
Helen...

1027
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:14,600
Never thought I'd see the day.

1028
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:22,720
Where do you think he is,
heaven or hell?

1029
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:30,320
Who knows?

1030
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:50,480
Farewell, my son.
